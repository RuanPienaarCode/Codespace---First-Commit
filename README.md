ITW_03.7: Challenge: Upload project to GitHub
Either initialize a local Git repository inside the folder where you created Resumé 1, or create a remote repository on GitHub.
Local Repository
If you created a local repository first, run git -M to rename your master branch to 'main', then create a remote repository on GitHub and link this remote repo to your local one.
Finally add all your changes to the staging area locally, commit them, and run git push origin main to push the code from your local repo to GitHub
GitHub
If you decided to create a remote repo on GitHub first, clone the repository in the folder where you work on all your projects.
After the repo has been cloned, copy Resumé 1 into the local repository that was just created.
Commit your changes once you've added all your files.
Finally push them to GitHub to see the changes.


Project - ITW2
Create a web page that looks like the example below.
Your image should be saved in a folder called “Images” in your project folder.
Include a list of links to the different sections on the page.
Include a link to an external website.
Once you're finished add your changes to your repository's staging area, commit them, and push them to GitHub so you can submit.
